    <p class="page4-footer">The equity allocation of your portfolio is customized to screen out and weight companies according to the values you selected. Instead of owning a fund of stocks that you have no control over the composition of, your portfolio contains individual companies- only the ones that align with what you care about. To give you a fully diversified portfolio with a risk profile that is appropriate for your financial situation, we’ve also included other asset classes (think bonds, real estate, and commodities). These types of investments are not traded the same way as stocks, so you own exchange traded funds (ETFs) here instead of individual assets.</p>
